    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <details open>
      <summary>My Childhood</summary>
      <p>I was born in Bengaluru,India. I thought i had friends in my school days but, I realised that they were only pretending to be my friends. I missed those days when I felt I had friends, even though it wasn't a real friendship, inside my mind I felt that I had friends. That feeling of assuming fake friendship as real was really better than my present situation as for now people rarely talk to me, I know people can't always spend their time talking to me but I really feel miserable as I don't know what to talk to people and I always end up hurting people. Maybe, this is the reason I lose most of the people and end up hurting others and myself too. Sorry, for writing this in my final assignment. I was really feeling heavy inside and since I cannot say this to anyone and bother them, I just wrote it here to releive myself. Once again really sorry :(</p>
